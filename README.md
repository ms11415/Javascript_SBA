This is a simple, 3 page website for dog lovers who want to adopt a dog.  The home page features flexbox divs, a video, CSS flash 
animation, an HTML table, and a form to subscribe to the site newsletter. The form uses HTML regex for validation.

The application page has a form to apply to adopt.  The "states" option box was dynamically populated using JavaScript and JQuery.  It 
uses HTML regex for validation.

The gallery page uses a grid layout to show photos of various dogs.  The page uses JavaScript and JQuery to change the font color
of the dogs on mouse hover.

All pages use Google fonts and a dropdown menu that is styled with SASS.
